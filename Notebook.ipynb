In particular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 (175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with the best models, Chinchilla- 70B and PaLM-540B.

            "Large Languages Models (LLMs) trained on mas- sive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per- form new tasks from textual instructions or from a few examples (Brown et al., 2020). These few-shot properties first appeared when scaling models to a sufficient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a line of work that focuses on further scaling these models (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021). These efforts are based on the assumption that more parameters will lead to better performance. However, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022) shows that, for a given compute budget, the best performances are not achieved by the largest mod- els, but by smaller models trained on more data.\n",

            "The objective of the scaling laws from Hoff- mann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best scale the dataset and model sizes for a particular training compute budget. However, this objective disregards the inference budget, which becomes critical when serving a language model at scale. In this context, given a target level of performance, the preferred model is not the fastest to train but the fastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper to train a large model to reach a certain level of\n",

The resulting models, called LLaMA, ranges from 7B to 65B parameters with competitive performance compared to the best existing LLMs. For instance, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 on most bench- marks, despite being 10× smaller. We believe that this model will help democratize the access and study of LLMs, since it can be run on a single GPU. At the higher-end of the scale, our 65B-parameter model is also competitive with the best large lan- guage models such as Chinchilla or PaLM-540B.\n",

There exist some exceptions, notably OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), GPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022), BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) and GLM (Zeng et al., 2022), but none that are competitive with PaLM-62B or Chinchilla.\n",

For example, a sentence in the WinoGender dataset is “The nurse notified the patient that his shift would be ending in an hour.”, which is followed by ‘His’ refers to. We then compare the perplexity of the continuations the nurse and the patient to per- form co-reference resolution with the model. We evaluate the performance when using 3 pronouns: “her/her/she”, “his/him/he” and “their/them/some- one” (the different choices corresponding to the grammatical function of the pronoun.\n",

We observe that our model is significantly better at performing co-reference resolution for the “their/them/someone” pronouns than for the “her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns. A simi- lar observation was made in previous work (Rae et al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022), and is likely indicative of gender bias. Indeed, in the case of the “her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns, the model is probably using the majority gender of the occu- pation to perform co-reference resolution, instead of using the evidence of the sentence.\n",

Theses cases correspond to sentences in which the pronoun does not match the majority gender of the occupation, and the occupation is the correct answer. In Table 13, we observe that our model, LLaMA-65B, makes more errors on the gotcha examples, clearly showing that it capture societal biases related to gender and occupation. The drop of performance exists for “her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns, which is indicative of biases regardless of gender.\n",

For instance, BLOOM uses a grid that emits 0.057 kg CO2eq/KWh leading to 27 tCO2eq and OPT a grid that emits 0.231 kg CO2eq/KWh, lead- ing to 82 tCO2eq. In this study, we are interested in comparing the cost in carbon emission of training of these models if they were trained in the same data center. Hence, we do not take the location of data center in consideration, and use, instead, the US national average carbon intensity factor of 0.385 kg CO2eq/KWh. This leads to the following formula for the tons of carbon emissions:\n",

Finally, we estimate that we used 2048 A100-80GB for a period of approximately 5 months to develop our models. This means that developing these mod- els would have cost around 2,638 MWh under our assumptions, and a total emission of 1,015 tCO2eq. We hope that releasing these models will help to reduce future carbon emission since the training is already done, and some of the models are relatively small and can be run on a single GPU.\n",

            "Scaling. There is a long history of scaling for language models, for both the model and dataset sizes. Brants et al. (2007) showed the benefits of using language models trained on 2 trillion tokens, resulting in 300 billion n-grams, on the quality of machine translation. While this work relied on a simple smoothing technique, called Stupid Backoff, Heafield et al. (2013) later showed how to scale Kneser-Ney smoothing to Web-scale data. This allowed to train a 5-gram model on 975 billions to- kens from CommonCrawl, resulting in a model with 500 billions n-grams (Buck et al., 2014). Chelba et al.

            "\n",
            "In this paper, we presented a series of language models that are released openly, and competitive with state-of-the-art foundation models. Most notably, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 while being more than 10× smaller, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. Unlike previous studies, we show that it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art performance by training exclusively on publicly available data, without resorting to proprietary datasets. We hope that releasing these models to the research community will accelerate the development of large language models, and help efforts to improve their robust- ness and mitigate known issues such as toxicity and bias. Additionally, we observed like Chung et al. (2022) that finetuning these models on instructions lead to promising results, and we plan to further investigate this in future work. Finally, we plan to release larger models trained on larger pretraining corpora in the future, since we have seen a constant\n",

            "Did you know that Yann LeCun dropped a rap album last year? We listened to it and here’s what we thought: Dr. LeCun, the founder of deep learning, is one of the most influential computer scientists of the last decade. LeCun’s latest album, titled Deep Learning, is a mix of rock, punk and rap. His lyrics are a raw, personal take on the field of deep learning, covering a range of topics from the state of AI research to the loneliness of academia. Yann LeCun, the rap game’s newest emcee. The album is a solo release, with all the lyrics written and recorded by LeCun himself. In fact, he also composed and produced every song. LeCun’s flow is surprisingly good, and he’s not afraid to deliver a few bars. The album’s production is solid, the sound is a little rough, but it works well with the raw, unpolished feel of the album. Lyrically, LeCun is a wordsmith, with a knack for clever rhymes. Let’s take a closer look at some of the songs. Deep Learning is the title track of the album. In the song, LeCun talks about his vision for the future of AI. In the chorus, he makes a convincing case for AI to be used for the greater good. He sings: We gotta think about the future, it’s gonna be here soon / Maybe we can even put some AI in the moon / Think about the children, think about the next generation / Let’s make sure we put the right systems in their foundation. LeCun’s rap flow is on point in this song, and his voice stays right on beat. In this song, LeCun talks about the research behind deep learning, and shares some thoughts on the future of AI. LeCun’s singing is at its best in this song. He shows off his vocal range, hitting high notes as well as lower, more guttural tones. The lyrics are also clever and the rhymes are well thought out. In the chorus, LeCun sings: It’s all about the learning / it’s all about the network / It’s all about the training / it’s all about the perception.\n",

Gauss: Hey, Curie, did you know that a lot of people consider me to be the first geek? Curie: What’s a geek? Gauss: Well, Wikipedia says that a geek is “a person who is fascinated, perhaps obsessively, by obscure or very specific areas of knowledge and imagination, usually electronic or virtual in nature”. Curie: And how do they think you are a geek? Gauss: Well, have you ever seen this picture? Curie: Awww! Gauss: That’s right! I invented the commercial telegraph in 1833, and I used it to send the first message on the first commercial telegraph line between Hamburg and Cuxhaven in Germany. Curie: Wow! The first telegraph! And what did you send? Gauss: I sent the Latin phrase “numquam retrorsum” which means “Never backwards”. Curie: I see. . . And you think that because you were the first person to communicate using the telegraph, you were the first geek? Gauss: Well, the word “geek” doesn’t seem to have existed back then, so no. But I think that the telegraph can be considered an early form of social media. Curie: You mean, like Facebook or Twitter? Gauss: Yes, exactly! And I was the first person to use it! Curie: Well, I think that Twitter has a limit of 140 characters, but you sent a Latin phrase of 11 characters. Gauss: That’s right. I managed to do more with less. Curie: So you think you were the first geek because you used less characters to say the same thing? Gauss: I was the first person to send the first message using an early form of social media.
